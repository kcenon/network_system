/**
 * @file http2_server.cpp
 * @brief HTTP/2 server implementation stub for network-http2 library
 *
 * This file serves as a placeholder for the network-http2 library.
 * The actual implementation is provided by the main network_system
 * library through the re-exported headers.
 *
 * When building as part of network_system, this stub is not compiled
 * as the implementation comes from src/protocols/http2/http2_server.cpp.
 *
 * For standalone builds, this file can be extended to include
 * necessary implementation details.

// Placeholder implementation
// The actual http2_server implementation is in the main network_system library
// This stub exists for library structure completeness
