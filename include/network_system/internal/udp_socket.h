	 * \class udp_socket
	 * \brief A lightweight wrapper around \c asio::ip::udp::socket,
	 *        enabling asynchronous datagram operations.
	 *
	 * ### Key Features
	 * - Maintains a \c socket_ (from ASIO) for UDP communication.
	 * - Exposes \c set_receive_callback() to handle inbound datagrams
	 *   along with sender endpoint information.
	 * - Exposes \c set_error_callback() for error handling.
	 * - \c start_receive() begins an ongoing loop of \c async_receive_from().
	 * - \c async_send_to() performs an asynchronous send to a specified endpoint.
	 *
	 * ### Thread Safety
	 * - All public methods are thread-safe. Callback registration is protected
	 *   by callback_mutex_.
	 * - ASIO operations are serialized through the io_context, ensuring
	 *   read_buffer_ is only accessed by one async operation at a time.
	 * - The provided callbacks will be invoked on an ASIO worker thread;
	 *   ensure that your callback logic is thread-safe if it shares data.
	 *
	 * ### UDP Characteristics
	 * - Connectionless: Each datagram is independent.
	 * - No guaranteed delivery: Packets may be lost, duplicated, or reordered.
	 * - Message boundaries preserved: Each receive corresponds to one send.
