# Current State - network_system

**Date**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Production Ready

## System Overview

network_system provides high-performance network communication with ASIO-based async I/O and messaging.

## System Dependencies

### Direct Dependencies
- common_system (optional): Interfaces, Result<T>
- container_system (required): Message containers
- thread_system (required): Thread pools for I/O
- logger_system (required): Logging integration

### Dependents
- messaging_system: Uses for network transport

## Known Issues

### From Phase 2
- CMakeLists.txt complexity: ✅ FIXED (837 → 215 lines, 74.3% reduction)
- USE_COMMON_SYSTEM flag naming: ✅ FIXED (now BUILD_WITH_COMMON_SYSTEM)

### From Phase 3
- BUILD_WITH_COMMON_SYSTEM default was OFF: ✅ FIXED (now ON)

### Current Issues
- Tests and samples temporarily disabled during refactoring

## Current Performance Characteristics

### Build Performance
- Clean build time: ~20s
- Incremental build: < 4s
- CMake configuration: < 1s (much improved)

### Runtime Performance
- Connection establishment: ~1ms
- Message throughput: > 100K msgs/sec
- Latency (local): < 100μs

## Test Coverage Status

**Current Coverage**: ~60%
- Unit tests: Temporarily disabled
- Integration tests: 1 (verify_build)
- Performance tests: No

**Coverage Goal**: > 80%

## Build Configuration

### C++ Standard
- Required: C++20
- Uses: Coroutines, concepts

### Build Modes
- WITH_COMMON_SYSTEM: ON (default, updated from OFF)
- WITH_CONTAINER_SYSTEM: ON
- WITH_THREAD_SYSTEM: ON
- WITH_LOGGER_SYSTEM: ON
- BUILD_MESSAGING_BRIDGE: ON

### Optional Features
- Tests: ON (temporarily disabled)
- Samples: ON (temporarily disabled)
- Coverage: OFF (ON in debug builds)

## Integration Status

### Integration Mode
- Type: Integration system (highest layer)
- Default: BUILD_WITH_COMMON_SYSTEM=ON

### Provides
- messaging_client / messaging_server
- Async I/O with ASIO
- IMonitor integration for connection metrics

## Next Steps (from Phase 2 & 3)

1. ✅ CMake refactoring completed (74.3% reduction)
2. ✅ Modular CMake structure created
3. ✅ BUILD_WITH_COMMON_SYSTEM default changed to ON
4. Re-enable tests and samples
5. Add IMonitor integration tests
