## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | v1.0 | v2.0 | Improvement |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Throughput | 95K msg/s | 305K msg/s | 3.2x |
| Latency (P50) | 1.8ms | 0.6ms | 3x |
| Latency (P99) | 15ms | 5ms | 3x |
| Concurrent Connections | 200 | 500+ | 2.5x |
| Memory per Connection | 24KB | 10KB | 2.4x |

## 🔄 Breaking Changes

### Namespace Changes
- `messaging_system` → `network_system`
- `network_module` preserved for compatibility

### API Changes
- `send_message()` → `send_packet()`
- `on_message()` → `on_packet()`
- New async/await pattern with coroutines

### Configuration
- YAML configuration format (was JSON)
- Environment variable overrides
- Hot-reload support

## 🚀 Migration from v1.x

### Quick Migration
```cpp
// Old (v1.x)
auto server = messaging_system::server::create("server");
server->start(8080);

// New (v2.0) - Compatibility mode
auto server = network_module::create_server("server");
server->start_server(8080);

// New (v2.0) - Native API
auto server = std::make_shared<network_system::core::messaging_server>("server");
server->start_server(8080);
```

### Gradual Migration Strategy
1. Update includes to use compatibility headers
2. Test with backward compatibility layer
3. Gradually migrate to new namespaces
4. Update to use new features (coroutines, etc.)
